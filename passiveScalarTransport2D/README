"""
Write a program to transport a passive
scalar in 2D.
▪ Prescribe a momentum field and a
(constant density)
▪ Compute the velocity at the faces
(mom2Vel)
▪ Compute the convective and diffusive
fluxes (calcFluxConCDS, calcFluxDif )
at the faces
▪ Sum the computed fluxes up at the cell
center
▪ Advance the solution in time by adding
the flux at the cell center to the
previous solution
▪ Repeat the last three steps until the
desired numer of time steps is reached
(as for your 1D-code in lecture 3)
▪ Testcase: a jet
▪ Play with the program
