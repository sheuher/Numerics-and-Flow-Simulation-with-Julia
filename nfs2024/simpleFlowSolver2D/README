Simple flow solver in 2D
▪ Extend your "passive scalar transport"
program to also consider the transport
of momentum in x- and y-direction
▪ After you have advanced the solution
in time, you need to do the pressure
correction in addition for the
momentum (divMom2D,
poissonSolver2D, corrMom2D)
▪ At the end of the time step, you need
to update the velocity at the faces
(mom2Vel)
▪ Play with your program, try the effect
of different parameters, discretisation
schemes for convection, Reynolds
numbers, grid resolutions, ...
Keep this program for your reference in
the future. If it works, you are one of the
very few (non)-PhD students who ever
wrote a flow solver!
