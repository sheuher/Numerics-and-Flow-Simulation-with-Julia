# Numerics-and-Flow-Simulation-with-Julia

This is part of attempt of exercises from coursework Numerics and Flow Simulation offered at the University Duisburg-Essen, 
  by no means sample solutions.

The ideas of this 'project':
- familiarize with computaional fluid dynamics, numerics/mathematics
- familiarize with programming language Julia

The goals of this 'project':
- tackle basic ideas and mathematical methods of CFD
- break down CFD equations/problem into smaller digestable problems, write own solution in code
- develop a simple 2D CFD Explicit solver
